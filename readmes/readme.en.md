# Autotemtem

## Notice!!
   
This bot uses OpenCV to image analyze your screen.  
You will not get banned, except for using too exaggerated.  
The bot always uses the first technique in the current version.  
I will add a function that can customize the technique you want to use.

## Setting

FullScreen or borderless  
Language: Chinese or English(in the future)   
Resolution: 1920x1080  
UI resolution: 1080  

## Luma hunt

The bot will keep running until it encounters the luma temtem.  
If it encounters the luma temtem, it will leave the game.    

## Rader

This function is the same as Luma hunt, but it will use the 1st technique not run.  
If enemies still do not die, it will use 2nd technique.

## Automatic weekly release

Use the way of releasing Hazrat in Braeside Castle.    
If there has no temcard+ in your bag, it will use a smoke bomb and go to the store to buy temcard+.  
Please test this function in Braeside Castle before using it.

## Auto leveling

You need to place the temtem you want to level in the second slot.  
The bot will heal temtems by using temessence Phial or using a smoke bomb to heal.
